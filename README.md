Using the Main Class

The Main class provides a command-line interface to interact with either a FullNode or a TemporaryNode in a network environment. Follow the instructions below to use the Main class effectively.

Compile the Code:
Before using the Main class, make sure to compile all the Java files included in the submission. You can compile the code using the following command:

Terminal:
javac *.java

Run the Main Class:
After compiling the code, you can run the Main class to start either a FullNode or a TemporaryNode. Execute the following command:

Terminal:
java Main

Enter User Information:
Upon running the Main class, you will be prompted to enter your email address, a unique identifier for your node, and choose whether to start a FullNode or a TemporaryNode. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the required information.

Start a FullNode:
If you choose to start a FullNode, you will be asked to provide the IP address and port number for the node. Enter the required information as prompted.

Start a TemporaryNode:
If you choose to start a TemporaryNode, you will need to provide the address of the starting FullNode to which the temporary node will connect.

Interact with the Nodes:
Once the node is started, you can interact with it by entering commands such as PUT, GET, or END (to exit). Follow the on-screen instructions to execute these commands.

Compile and Run Again:
If you make changes to the code or wish to start another node, you can recompile the code and run the Main class again following the steps mentioned above.
